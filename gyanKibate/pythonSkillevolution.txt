Good. Now we’re building a training system, not just asking for random exercises. 🧠⚙️

You already have the Concept Module Prompt (the first one).
Now I’ll give you the Progressive Skill Evolution Prompt — this one is for leveling up systematically.

Then I’ll explain exactly when to use which one.

🚀 Progressive Python Skill Evolution Prompt

Use this when you want structured long-term growth.

Act as a senior Python mentor designing a progressive mastery roadmap.

I am currently at this level:
<BEGINNER / EARLY INTERMEDIATE / INTERMEDIATE / ADVANCED>

Concept focus:
<INSERT CONCEPT OR TOPIC>

My goal:
<e.g., build real-world projects, master problem solving, prepare for backend development, etc.>

Design a progressive training system for me that includes:

1. Skill Diagnosis
   - What I should already know at this level.
   - Common weaknesses at this stage.
   - Warning signs that I am faking understanding.

2. Layered Learning Plan
   Break learning into 4 stages:
   - Stage 1: Foundation Strengthening
   - Stage 2: Controlled Complexity
   - Stage 3: Integration with Other Concepts
   - Stage 4: Real-world Application

3. Progressive Exercises
   - 5 easy problems
   - 5 moderate problems
   - 5 hard problems
   - 2 system-level problems

   Each level must increase cognitive demand.
   No solutions unless I ask.

4. Skill Escalation Rules
   - How to know when to move to the next difficulty.
   - Metrics to evaluate myself.

5. Failure Handling
   - What to do when stuck.
   - How to debug thinking, not just code.

6. Mastery Test
   - One challenge that proves real understanding.

Do NOT give generic advice.
Be specific and demanding.
Focus on real skill-building.

🧭 When To Use Which Prompt

Now this is important. If you use them randomly, you waste power.

🔹 Use the FIRST Prompt (Concept Module Prompt) When:

You are learning something new.

Example:

“I want to learn generators.”

“I want to understand decorators.”

“I’m starting recursion.”


It gives:

Definitions

Terms

Structured exercises

Concept clarity


Think of it as:
Zoom in → Understand one tool deeply.


---

🔹 Use the SECOND Prompt (Progressive Mastery Prompt) When:

You already know basics but feel stuck or plateaued.

Example:

“I know lists, loops, functions… but I don’t feel strong.”

“I’ve been coding for 2 years but still hesitate.”

“I want to move from beginner to intermediate.”


It gives:

Diagnosis

Difficulty scaling

Cognitive stress training

Real evaluation metrics


Think of it as:
Zoom out → Build long-term strength.

🧠 Strategic Usage Pattern (This Is What You Should Do)

Since I know you tend to overthink fundamentals and delay execution, here’s the optimal cycle:

1. Pick ONE concept.


2. Use Prompt #1.


3. Practice.


4. Build a mini project.


5. Then use Prompt #2 on that same concept to test depth.


6. Move on.



That prevents:

Endless planning

Endless relearning

Fake confidence

Tutorial addiction

⚔️ Brutal Truth

You don’t lack knowledge. You lack deliberate difficulty exposure.

Skill only grows when:

Problems feel slightly uncomfortable.

You can’t immediately see the solution.

You wrestle with bugs without panic.


That’s the arena.
