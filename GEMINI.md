# GEMINI Project Context

## Directory Overview

This directory, `learning-projects`, is a personal educational repository focused on learning and practicing Python programming. It serves as a "learning lab" containing notes, exercises, and small, hands-on projects. The structure is organized by topic and complexity, allowing for a progressive learning path from basic to advanced concepts.

## Key Files and Directories

*   **`README.md`**: The main entry point, explaining the purpose and structure of the repository as a personal learning space.

*   **`python/`**: The root directory for all Python-related content.
    *   **`1_basics/`**: Contains materials for foundational Python concepts.
        *   `concept_notes.md`: A cheat sheet for operator overloading in Python.
        *   `exercises/`: Includes practical exercises like `inheritance_OOPS_1.1.py`, which covers inheritance, properties, and operator overloading.
    *   **`2_advanced/`**: A directory intended for advanced Python topics (currently a placeholder).
    *   **`mini-projects/`**: A collection of small, runnable command-line applications.
        *   `README.md`: Provides an overview and instructions for running each mini-project.
        *   `calculator.py`: A simple command-line calculator.
        *   `todo_list.py`: A CLI application for managing tasks.
        *   `number_guessing_game.py`: A game where the user guesses a random number.
        *   `rock_paper_scissors.py`: The classic game against the computer.
    *   **`experimentation.py`**: A scratchpad file for quickly testing code snippets and ideas without creating a new file.

## Usage and Development

This repository is intended for personal learning and experimentation.

*   **Running Mini-Projects**: The applications in the `python/mini-projects/` directory are designed to be run directly from the command line. To run a project, navigate to the `python/mini-projects/` directory and execute it with Python.

    ```bash
    # Example of running the calculator
    python python/mini-projects/calculator.py
    ```

*   **Studying Concepts**: The `1_basics` and `2_advanced` directories are for structured learning. The `concept_notes.md` files provide theoretical knowledge, while the `exercises` folders contain practical coding problems to solidify understanding.

*   **Experimenting**: The `python/experimentation.py` file is a designated "sandbox" for trying out new code or debugging small logic snippets.
