## Projects

### 1. Calculator (`calculator.py`)

#### Description
A simple command-line calculator application that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, floor division, exponents, remainder on two numbers).

#### How to Run
To run the calculator, navigate to this directory in your terminal and execute:
```bash
python calculator.py
```

#### Features
- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Handles integer and floating-point numbers.
- User-friendly command-line interface.

### 2. To-Do List Application (`todo_list.py`)

#### Description
A command-line to-do list application that allows users to manage their daily tasks. This project is great for practicing list manipulation and user input handling.

#### How to Run
```bash
python todo_list.py
```

#### Features
- View all tasks in the to-do list.
- Add a new task to the list.
- Mark a task as completed.
- Remove a task from the list.


### 3. Number Guessing Game (`number_guessing_game.py`)

#### Description
A program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it.
If the player’s guess is higher than the actual number, the program displays “Lower number please”. Similarly, if the user’s guess is too low, the program prints “higher number please” When the user guesses the correct number, the program displays the number of guesses the player used to arrive at the number.

#### How to Run
```bash
python number_guessing_game.py
```

#### Features
- Generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- Provides hints to the user ("Higher" or "Lower").
- Counts the number of attempts it takes to guess the number.
