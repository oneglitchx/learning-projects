# 🧠 Learning Projects

This repository is my personal **learning lab** — a place where I explore programming and computational thinking through practical, hands-on projects.

It contains all the small programs, exercises, and experiments I’ve created while learning. Each folder represents a topic, concept, or language I’ve worked on — starting with **Python**, and expanding as I learn more.

## 📂 Structure
learning-projects/ ├── python/ │   ├── basics/ │   ├── advance/ │   └── mini-projects/ └── ...

Each section includes practice code, mini-projects, and experiments that help me understand how things really work under the hood.

## 💡 Purpose

- Learn by building  
- Document progress and growth  
- Keep all learning projects organized in one place

## ⚙️ Current Focus

**Python 🐍**  
(Will expand to other languages as I progress)
